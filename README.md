a) I came up with the seting up of variables by assigning  proper values (as it has been asked in the assignment) to them and I have used if function after that called them using the read function.

b) My script must execute on the terminal of Ubuntu using this command <./gradingSystem.sh>

c) I have copied, pasted and assigned  the VERBOSE variables the required values,  using and understanding  VERBOSE variables are quite easily.

d) If the compilation command failed, the program will show me where the error is and it will automatically terminate the program, if the input from the user would be wrong I would simply use a while loop to re-enter the value so the program run in a smoth way.

e) for getting input from the user, I will ask the user to enter the required "Input" by displaying a message (echo " write please"), and use the "read function" to get the input from the user.

f) for students grades in integers I used the if function in instance, (if [ $total -eq 90 ]), If the input is in characters it would automatically give an error.

g) I have used this command (echo "$yourrecords " >>thefile.txt), Now everytime the script run the following command it would keep adding records to the same file "thefile.txt".
